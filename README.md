Breast Cancer Classification utilizing Scikit-Learn machine learning library
This program seeks to show both the ability and realibility of machine learning in medical imaging
By utilizing different machine learning techniques, we can discover the most effective means of
classifying breast cancer from histopathology images, and whether it would be worthwhile to incorporate
at a large scale in the medical field. We also seek to create a peristent model which can be improved over multiple
training sessions.

The idea for this project came from https://data-flair.training/blogs/project-in-python-breast-cancer-classification/ .
The code for this project was adapted from https://github.com/ifueko/sklearn-basics.
The dataset used for this project can be found https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images .
